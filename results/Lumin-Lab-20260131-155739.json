        "Semantics Lawyer": "Python API check: list.sort() mutates and returns None, while sorted() returns a new list; mixing these incorrectly breaks the contract.",
        "Counterexample Hunter": "I can break it with a tiny input: input [2, 1, 2] produces incorrect ordering, input [0, -1] mishandled",
        "Complexity Auditor": "Side effects and aliasing matter: if the caller reuses the original list, in-place mutation changes external state unexpectedly.",
        "Socratic Tutor": "Let\u2019s test a concrete input and walk through every step to see where the ordering guarantee fails."

      "conflict": "Verifier and Semantics Lawyer disagree: the Verifier flags a broken ordering invariant, while the Semantics Lawyer says the Python API usage itself already makes the output invalid.",
      "reconciled_challenge": "Strongest critique: comparison logic does not guarantee a nondecreasing order Counterexample(s): input [2, 1, 2] produces incorrect ordering, input [0, -1] mishandled. Invariant check: the output should be a sorted permutation of the input, but the current behavior violates that requirement on the examples above.",
